    An integer describes the state of a number of nodes, the state of the ith node
    being defined as the ith digit of the integer when in base 'base'. 
    
    When talking about a subset of nodes, its convenient to condense this notation.
    Thus the ith digit now refers to the ith node in the subset. 
    
    This function converts a integer referring to the state of the system to the 
    reduced state which only refers to the subset.
    
    For example: 5 nodes, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    
    The current state is 01101 which is described by the integer 13.
    
    For the subset 0, 2,3 the corresponding state is 111, and thus the integer 
    is 7. This function changes 13 to 7 given the subset [0, 2, 3]

    This answer is not unique. Given the subset [0,2,3] in [0,1,2,3,4], the binary
    string of 111 could equivelantly be translated to 11111 or 10110.
